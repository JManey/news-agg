This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

HackerNews new feed.

This app was created by following along with a tutorial. The main goal was to learn testing with jest.

Learned how to write the tests and generate a test coverage report.

Bonus learned about the Lighthouse extension for chrome to scan your website and get a report on useability.
